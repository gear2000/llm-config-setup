## PR report contract v1

Use this Markdown report for these opt-in prompts. It is not a replacement for the existing Pi PR reviewer or any automated report schema. If the caller supplies a stricter schema, preserve it and carry the evidence in its permitted fields. If it cannot represent a required limitation, report that mismatch through its allowed non-approval path rather than inventing fields.

```text
# PR report v1: <role or skill>

## Snapshot
Repository and PR identity, or explicit prepublication candidate
Base: <commit ID>
Head: <commit ID>
Merge base: <commit ID>
Scope: <requested checks and explicit exclusions>
Evidence sources and observation time: <local inspection, remote reads, supplied reports>

## Verdict: APPROVED | APPROVED WITH NITS | CHANGES REQUESTED

## Checks
For each criterion: stable ID, expectation, PASS / FAIL / UNVERIFIED,
method, evidence location and observation, and remaining gap.
Distinguish static inspection, executed tests, and supplied results not rerun.

## Findings
For each demonstrated defect:
### <stable finding ID>: <title>
**Severity**: critical | major | minor | nit
**Location**: revision-qualified file:line or remote evidence location
**Issue**: violated contract, trigger/preconditions, and concrete consequence
**Fix**: smallest proposed correction and how to verify it

## Limits
Unchecked scope, unavailable evidence, stale reports, disagreements,
and the next checks needed. State that this report grants no merge authority.
```

Choose exactly one verdict. APPROVED means the requested scope passed its currently required checks, not that the whole PR is safe. APPROVED WITH NITS permits only optional, nonblocking improvements with required checks satisfied. Use CHANGES REQUESTED for demonstrated blocking defects or important required verification gaps. Put gaps in Checks and Limits as UNVERIFIED, not fabricated defect findings. An empty findings list or green subset is not approval. A missing expected-check policy is a gap for readiness, not proof that no checks are required.

Retain existing criterion and finding IDs across rounds. Use role-prefixed IDs for new findings, such as `PR-TEST-001`, and do not renumber inherited IDs. Deduplicate by root cause while retaining every source ID and affected location. Preserve unresolved disagreements. Skill-specific draft text or recheck dispositions may follow the default report, but never append extra blocks to a stricter caller schema.
